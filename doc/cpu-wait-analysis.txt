The figure above shows a scheduling history of two virtual CPUs on a single
physical CPU.

The figure starts in a state, in which at the time t_0, VCPU_1 is running.

We assume that VCPU_1 becomes idle at the moment t_1, and volunteerely donates
its time-slice (yields) to Xen by invoking a special hypercall. 

At the time t_1, execution is transfered to Xen, as a result of the yield
invocation. Xen performs a context switch (t_1 - t_2), and gives CPU to VCPU_2.

At the time t_2, despite the fact that VCPU_1 is not running, it's still not in
the waiting state, since it's natural to assume that it's still idle.

At time t_3, an event, like an event channel notification, arrives to the
physical CPU, which has to be processed by VCPU_1. At this point, VCPU_1 enters
the wait state -- it's waiting on the physical CPU, to start processing an
event. VCPU_1 remains in the waiting state until it gets scheduled by Xen, at
time t_5. At this time, it can finally process the event.  According to our
definition, the wait time in this case is:  

   wait_time = t_5 - t_3


Analysis
--------

Wait time analysis is aimed to compute the total wait time for each VCPU
over its run.

It may happen that no event arrives while VCPU is preempted, and in this case
the wait time is zero.

It may also happen, that VPCU doesn't yield it's slice volunteerely. In this
case it's preempted, and the wait time is equal to t_5 - t_1, even if no events
arrive at this period of time. 

Some comments
-------------

At some point, I was optimistically claiming that the wait time is somehow
caused by the fact that VCPU gets blocked. Rob was sceptical about this, and he
was right. Although, VCPUs can get blocked under certain conditions (e.g.
paused), I don't think it's an often event. I guess, the definition of wait, as
I give it above, makes the most sense, but correct me if I'm wrong. 

I think we can define "packet wait" in a similar way -- the amount of time
domain spends off-line while the packet is ready for processing.
